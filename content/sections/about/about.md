After 6 and a half years of working at a oil and gas field automation company I was made the head QA/QC engineer. After six months I felt that I had gone as far as I would go in that company and was not ready to stop learning and progressing in my career. 

I have always had an interest in the technology field and knew that was the direction I wanted to go. I found out about Lambda School and the opportunity that they offered. I am excited to continue to learn and realize my goal of becoming a successful Web Developer.
